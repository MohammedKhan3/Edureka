### NetflixClone Project
# Overview
This project is a clone of Netflix, designed to replicate the core features of the popular streaming service. It was inspired and guided by tutorials from two YouTube videos, which provided a foundational understanding of various web development concepts and technologies. This clone features a landing page, authentication (login and sign-up pages), and a main interface that displays movie and TV show trailers, posters, and descriptions.

# Key Features:
Landing Page: A welcoming first page that mimics the Netflix landing experience.
Authentication: Secure login and sign-up pages using Firebase for user authentication.
Netflix Main Page: Displays trailers, posters, and descriptions of movies and TV shows fetched from TMBD (The Movie Database).
# Learning Outcomes:
Through the development of this project, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of:

React Hooks: Leveraging React Hooks for state and lifecycle features in functional components.
Prop Drilling: Understanding and implementing prop drilling to pass data through the component tree.
Firebase Database: Utilizing Firebase as a backend service for storing and retrieving user data.
Middleware for Authentication: Implementing middleware in the authentication process to secure user sessions.
Axios: Fetching data from external APIs using Axios for seamless data integration.
