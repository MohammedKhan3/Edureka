# Portfolio Projects Overview
Welcome to my portfolio of mini projects, completed as part of my learning journey with Edureka. Each project was carefully chosen to dive deeper into different aspects of web development, from front-end design with HTML and CSS to full-stack development incorporating back-end services, databases, and modern JavaScript frameworks. Below, you'll find an overview of my top three projects that I'm particularly proud of.
